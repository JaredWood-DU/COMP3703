    "Fraudulent transactions often cannot be detected by looking at transactions in isolation. Instead, fraudulent transactions are detected by looking at patterns across multiple transactions from the same user, to the same merchant, or with other types of relationships. To express these relationships in a way that is understandable by a machine learning model, and to augment features with feature engineering, we We use the TemporianLinks to an external site. preprocessing library.\n",
